      On this page, you can explore the network of GitHub users.
      The total network consisted of 1585 nodes and 2092 connections, however only
      the <b>giant connected component</b> is shown here consisting of significantly less 
      nodes being <b>737</b> nodes and <b>2072</b> edges. The network <b>characteristics</b> are analysed
      as well as the text
      from the user profiles and repository descriptions
      by <b>term frequency</b>. This is then
      combined with a <b>sentiment analysis</b> of the individual users. 
      Additionally, the users are analysed based on their total stars, forks, followers as well as the number of
      users they follow themselves in order to
      see who are initially the most <b>popular users</b>.

    The nodes are scaled according to their node degree, 
    so that the nodes with the most connections to other nodes will appair with larger node size.
    The nodes are positioned based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing">
    Force Atlas 2 algorithm</a>, which is placing each 
    node spatially depending on its connection to the other nodes. Here it can already
    be seen that there are some very dominant users. <b>Hover</b> over the nodes to see who.

 <h3>Degree Distribution</h3>

</div>




  <div class = "textbox" > 

    Both the in- and out-degree distributions are asymmetric as they are right
     skewed with long tails. Although most users have zero or small degrees, there 
     are a few users with a large degree as well. This indicates the presence of a few 
     users that are highly connected to other users in the network. 
     These <b>highly connected hubs</b> of users can be seen as responsible for 
     keeping the network connected. So a removal of one of the key users would 
     have a huge impact on the network stucture. Since the hubs of key users 
     are highly connected, they collect information about other key users fast, 
     but they also spread information quickly to other users. 
     The log-log plots of the distributions demonstrate that the network follows
      the <b>power-law degree distribution</b> meaning that this network is <b>scale-free</b>. 
      This is a typical property of <b>real world networks</b>.

  </div>


  <div class = "textbox" > 

    From exploring the different centrality measures, some of the most
     central users according to
    <b>degree </b>-, <b>eigenvector</b>- and <b>betweenness</b> centrality were revealed.
    It can be seen that some of the most followed users in the network are 
    <a href="https://github.com/amueller"> amueller</a>
    and  <a href="https://github.com/ogrisel">ogrisel</a>, whereas 
    <a href="https://github.com/yupbank">yupbank</a> is the user who follows most of the other users. 
    Hence these three users are also the ones with most connections overall.  
    The users ogrisel, <a href="https://github.com/agramfort">agramfort</a> and  
    yupbank are central according 
    to eigenvector centrality meaning that they have <b>high influence</b> within the network.

  </div>

  <div class = "textbox" > 
    From the barcharts, it can be concluded that <a href="https://github.com/llSourcell">llSourcell</a> 
    is a very popular user with over 35K+ followers.
    He has a <a href="www.youtube.com/c/sirajraval">youtube channel</a>,
    and is also in the top 5 for
     having most total stars and total forks across his repositories. The user 
     <a href="https://github.com/rasbt">rasbt</a> is also
     mentioned in top 5 for these three variables and is a user more related to academia. 
     The user <a href="https://github.com/jwasham">jwasham</a> is also mentioned in top 
    5 and is the user with most stars across his repositories. 
     He has a blog, <a href="https://startupnextdoor.com">startupnextdoor</a>,
    where he shares leanings from running and starting web businesses, 
    thereby being more connected to industry.

  <h3>Word Clouds</h3>

  <div class = "textbox" > 
    Below the most frequent <b>single words</b> as well as <b>word pairs</b> within
    user biographies and repository descriptions are shown in word clouds. 
    The programming languages used in the repositories are also shown
    to get an overview of the most popular languages.  
  </div>


  <h4 style="color:#536872;">Repository descriptions</h4>

  <img src="visualizations/Repository descriptions - unigrams.png" alt="Snow" width="400"> 
  <img src="visualizations/Repository descriptions - bigrams.png" alt="Snow" width="400"> 
  

 
  <h4 style="color:#536872;"> User biographies </h4>

      <img src="visualizations/User biographies - bigrams.png" alt="Snow" width="400"> 
 

  
  <h4 style="color:#536872;"> Programming languages </h4>

      <img src="visualizations/Programming languages - bigrams.png" alt="Snow" width="400"> 
  

  <div class = "textbox" > 

    It is seen from the biographies that many users seem to be <i>engineers, scientiest, students, 
    phds, researchers</i> and <i>developers</i> indicating that the network has well educated 
    and hard working users. 
    Adding context from the words pairs this mostly regards <i>software, 
      computer </i> and 
    <i>data science</i> as well as <i>deep learning</i>. Python is big not only for 
    the programming languages but 
    also for the repository descriptions. So GitHub is definitely 
    popular for <b>Python</b> users and escpecially combined with <b>Jupyter notebook</b>. 
    Though, it is observed
    that many other languages are used as well.

    <h3> Sentiment Analysis</h3>

    <div class = "textbox" > 
      A <b>sentiment analysis</b> of the repository descriptions and biographies 
      written by the individual users is presented below. The happiness or sadness for each user 
      was determined
      by comparing the words in the texts to a predefined list of words with a related <b>happiness score</b>. 
      This list is available from the article 
      <a href=” http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0026752” > Temporal 
        Patterns of Happiness and Information in a Global Social Network: Hedonometrics and Twitter</a>. 
        Below the top happiest and saddest users based on their repository descriptions and biographies 
        are presented.
    </div>


  <div class="row">
    <div class="column">
      <center><h4 style="color:#536872;">Repository descriptions</h4></center>
      <img src="tables/sent_desc.png" alt="Forest" width="400">
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <center><h4 style="color:#536872;"> User biographies </h4></center>
      <img src="tables/sent_bio.png" alt="Forest" width="400">
    </div>
  </div>


  <div class = "textbox" > 

    Looking at the sentiment scores, it is seen that the user 
    <a href="https://github.com/gitter-badger"> gitter-badger</a> has a very 
    high sentiment score and is quite positive using words as <i>love</i> and <i>happiness</i>, 
    whereas 
    some users as <a href="https://github.com/Qovaxx"> Qovaxx</a> is deemed quite negative 
    due writing about <i>cancer</i>. It can also
     be concluded that users such as 
     <a href="https://github.com/dangsonbk">dangsonbk</a> and 
     <a href="https://github.com/weakish"> weakish</a> are probably not worth 
     following due biographies with words as <i>lazy </i>and <i>lost</i>. However this 
     obviously depends on what kind of users you are interested in.
