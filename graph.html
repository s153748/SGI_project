      <h2 style="color:#006372;">Explore the network of users</h2>
  
      On this page, you can explore the network of GitHub users.
      The total network consisted of 1585 nodes and 2092 connections, however we
      mainly look into the <b>giant connected component</b> consisting of significantly less 
      nodes being <b>737</b> nodes and <b>2072</b> edges. We analyse the network characteristics 
      as well as the <b>text </b>
      from the user profiles and repository descriptions
      by <b>term frequency</b>. This is then
      combined with a <b>sentiment analysis</b> of the individual users.

    The nodes are scaled according to their node degree, 
    so that the nodes with the most connections to other nodes will appair with larger node size.
    The nodes are positioned based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing">
    Force Atlas 2 algorithm</a>, which is placing each 
    node spatially depending on its connection to the other nodes. We already
    here see that there are some very dominant users. <b>Hover</b> over the nodes to see who.

 <h3>Degree distribution</h3>

  <div class = "textbox" > 

    Both the in- and out-degree distributions are asymmetric as they are right
     skewed with long tails. Although most users have zero or small degrees, there 
     are a few users with a large degree as well. This indicates the presence a few 
     users that are highly connected to other users in the network. 
     These <b>highly connected hubs</b> of users can be seen as responsible for 
     keeping the network connected. So a removal of one of the key users would 
     have a huge impact on the network stucture. Since the hubs of key users 
     are highly connected, they collect information about other key users fast, 
     but they also spread information quickly to other users. 
     The log-log plots of the distributions demonstrate that the network follows
      the <b>power-law degree distribution</b> meaning that this network is <b>scale-free</b>. 
      This is a typical property of <b>real world networks</b>.

  </div>


  <div class = "textbox" > 

    From exploring the different centrality measures, we could reveal some of the most
     central users according to
    <b>degree </b>, <b>eigenvector</b> and <b>betweenness</b> centrality.
    From the tables, it can be seen that some of the most followed users in the network are 
    <a href="https://github.com/amueller"> amueller</a>
    and  <a href="https://github.com/ogrisel">ogrisel</a>, whereas 
    <a href="https://github.com/yupbank">yupbank</a> is the user who follows most of the other users. 
    Hence these three users are also the ones with most connections overall.  
    We see that the users ogrisel, <a href="https://github.com/agramfort">agramfort</a> and  
    <a href="https://github.com/yupfort">yupfort</a> are central according 
    to eigenvector centrality meaning that they have <b>high influence</b> within the network.

  <h3>Word clouds</h3>

  <div class = "textbox" > 
    We analysed the words of the user biographies and repository descriptions. 
    Here, we also included the programming languages used in the repositories 
    to better get an overview of the 
    most used languages.  We present both the most frequent single words as well as word pairs. 
  </div>


  <h4 style="color:#536872;">Repository descriptions</h4>

  <h4 style="color:#536872;"> User biographies </h4>

  <h4 style="color:#536872;"> Programming languages </h4>

  <div class = "textbox" > 

    It is seen from the bios that many users seem to be <i>engineers, scientiest, students, 
    phds, researchers</i> and <i>developers</i> indicating the network has well educated and hard working users. 
    Adding context from the words pairs, this mostly regards <i>software, 
      computer </i> and 
    <i>data science</i> as well as <i>deep learning</i>. Python is big not only for 
    the programming languages, but 
    also for the repository descriptions. So GitHub is definitely 
    popular for <b>Python</b> users and escpecially combined with <b>Jupyter notebook</b>. Though, we also observe 
    that many other languages are used.

    <h3> Sentiment Analysis</h3>

    <div class = "textbox" > 
      Here, we introduce <b>sentiment analysis</b> of the repository descriptions and biographies 
      written by the individual users. We have determined the happiness or sadness for each user 
      by comparing the words in the texts to a predefined list of words with a related happiness score. 
      This list is available from the article 
      <a href=” http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0026752” > Temporal 
        Patterns of Happiness and Information in a Global Social Network: Hedonometrics and Twitter</a>. 
        We present top happiest and saddest users based on their repository descriptions and biographies.
    </div>


  <div class="row">
    <div class="column">
      <center><h4 style="color:#536872;">Repository descriptions</h4></center>
      <img src="tables/sent_desc.png" alt="Forest" width="400">
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <center><h4 style="color:#536872;"> User biographies </h4></center>
      <img src="tables/sent_bio.png" alt="Forest" width="400">
    </div>
  </div>


  <div class = "textbox" > 

    Looking at the sentiment scores, we do see that the user 
    <a href="https://github.com/gitter-badger"> gitter-badger</a> has a very 
    high sentiment score and is quite positive using words as <i>love</i> and <i>happiness</i>, 
    whereas 
    some users as <a href="https://github.com/Qovaxx"> Qovaxx</a> is deemed quite negative 
    due writing about <i>cancer</i>. It can also
     be concluded that users such as 
     <a href="https://github.com/dangsonbk">dangsonbk</a> and 
     <a href="https://github.com/weakish"> weakish</a> are probably not worth 
     following due bios with words as <i>lazy </i>and <i>lost</i>.
