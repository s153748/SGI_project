      <h2 style="color:#006372;">Explore the network of users</h2>
  
      On this page, you can explore the network of GitHub users both visually and in terms of
      an analysis. This is done for the giant connected component of the network consisting
      of 737 of th 1585 users. Further, we look into the texts from the user profiles and repository descriptions 
      combined with a sentiment analysis of the individual users.

    The nodes are scaled according to their node degree, 
    so that the nodes with the most connections to other nodes will appair with larger node size.
    The nodes are positioned based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing">
    Force Atlas 2 algorithm</a>, which is placing each node spatially depending on its connection to the other nodes.

 <h3 style="color:#536872;">Degree distribution</h3>
  <div class = "textbox" > 
    We first looked into the degree distribution for in- and out-degree that revealed

  <div class = "textbox" > 

    Both the in- and out-degree distributions are asymmetric as they are right
     skewed with long tails. Although most users have zero or small degrees, there 
     are a few users with a large degree as well. This indicates the presence a few 
     users that are highly connected to other users in the network. 
     These **highly connected hubs** of users can be seen as responsible for 
     keeping the network connected. So a removal of one of the key users would 
     have a huge impact on the network stucture. Since the hubs of key users 
     are highly connected, they collect information about other key users fast, 
     but they also spread information quickly to other users. 
     The log-log plots of the distributions demonstrate that the network follows
      the **power-law degree distribution** meaning that this network is **scale-free** . 
      This is a typical property of **real world networks**.

  <h3 style="color:#536872;">Centrality</h3>

  <div class = "textbox" > 
    Next, we explored different centrality measures revealing some of the most central users according 
    <b>degree </b>, <b>eigenvector</b> and <b>betweenness</b> centrality.

  <div class="row">
    <div class="column">

    <div class="column">
      <center> <h4> Eigenvector and betweenness centrality</h4></center>
  <img src="tables/eigen_between.png" alt="Forest" width="500">
    </div>
  </div>


  <div class = "textbox" > 
    From the tables it can be seen that some of the most followed users in the network are **amueller** 
    and **ogrisel**, whereas **yupbank** is the user who follows most of the other users. 
    Hence these three users are also the ones with most connections overall.  
    We see that the users **ogrisel** and **silverstone1903** are central according 
    to both degree- and eigenvector centrality. Further, the users **agramfort** and **yupfort** 
    is has a lot of influence both when it comes to in and out-degree eigenvector centrality 
    and betweenness centrality.

  <h3 style="color:#536872;">Word clouds</h3>

  <div class = "textbox" > 
    We analysed the words of the user biographies and repository descriptions based on term frequency. 
    Here, we also included the languages used in the repositories, to better get an overview of the 
    most used languages.  We present both the most frequent single words as well as word pairs. 
  </div>


  <h4>Repository descriptions</h4>

  <h4> User biographies </h4>

  <h4> Programming languages </h4>

  <div class = "textbox" > 

    It is seen from the bios that many users seem to be engineers, scientiest, students, 
    phds, researchers and developers indicating the network has well educated and hard working users. 
    Adding context from the words pairs, we can even add that this mostly regards software, computer and 
    data science as well as deep learning. Python is big not only for the programming languages, but 
    also for the repository descriptions, and a bit smaller for the bios. So GitHub is definitely 
    popular for Python users and escpecially with use of Jupyter notebook. Though, we also observe 
    that many other languages are also used.

    <h3 style="color:#536872;"> Sentiment Analysis</h3>

    <div class = "textbox" > 
      Here, we introduce **sentiment analysis** of the repository descriptions and biographies 
      written by the individual users. We have determined the happiness or sadness for each user 
      by comparing the words in the texts to a predefined list of words with a related happiness score. 
      This list is available from the article 
      <a href=” http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0026752” > Temporal 
        Patterns of Happiness and Information in a Global Social Network: Hedonometrics and Twitter</a>. 
        We present top 5 happiest and saddest users based on their repository descriptions and biographies.
     
    </div>


  <div class="row">
    <div class="column">
      <center><h4>Repository descriptions</h4></center>
      <img src="tables/sent_desc.png" alt="Forest" width="500">

    <div class="column">

      <img src="tables/sent_bio.png" alt="Forest" width="500">
    </div>
  </div>


  <div class = "textbox" > 

    Looking at the sentiment scores, we do see that the user **gitter-badger**  has a very 
    high sentiment score and is quite positive using words as love and happiness, whereas 
    some users as **Qovaxx** is deemed quite negative due writing about cancer. It can also
     be concluded that users such as **dangsonbk** and **weakish** are probably not worth 
     following due bios with words as lazy and lost.
