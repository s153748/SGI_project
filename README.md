# Social Graphs Project

This is the repo for the project made in the class 02805 Social Graphs and Interactions at DTU in the fall 2020.

In this project, we used graph theory to gain insight into the social network of GitHub users. We scraped the profiles of the owners as well as the contributers of the 70 top repositories matching a search of machine learning on GitHub resulting in a total of 1585 users. By running different analyses, our objective was to discover facts about these users regarding geographical locations, preferred programming languages and overall connections. We wanted to identify coding communities and their vibes to discover who are the most popular users and who you should follow to keep up with the trends. Check out our website to get an overview of our findings or go directly to our explainer notebook to check out the code.
